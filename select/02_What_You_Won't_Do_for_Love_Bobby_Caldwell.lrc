[00:12.28] I guess you wonder where I've been
[00:18.33] I searched to find a love within
[00:23.72] I came back to let you know
[00:28.94] Got a thing for you and I can't let go
[00:47.94] 
[00:35.00] My friends wonder what is wrong with me
[00:40.18] Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
[00:46.67] I came back to let you know
[00:51.22] Got a thing for you and I can't let go
[01:10.22] 
[00:57.63] Some people go around the world for love
[01:02.32] But they may never find what they dream of
[01:07.51] What you won't do, do for love
[01:13.49] You've tried everything, but you don't give up
[01:19.21] In my world only you make me do
[01:25.83] For love what I would not do
[01:39.83] 
[01:31.47] My friends wonder what is wrong with me
[01:36.45] Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see
[01:42.62] I came back to let you know
[01:47.52] Got a thing for you and I can't let go
[02:06.52] 
[01:54.38] But then I only want the best, it's true
[01:59.19] They can't believe the things I do for you
[02:04.50] What you won't do, do for love
[02:10.33] You've tried everything, but you won't give up
[02:16.26] In my world, only you make me do
[02:22.97] For love what I would not do
[02:27.89] Make me do for love what I would not do
[02:33.33] Make me do for love what I would not do
[02:38.78] Make me do for love what I would not do
