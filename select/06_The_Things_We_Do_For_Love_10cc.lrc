[00:18.96] Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
[00:23.76] Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea
[00:28.27] You lay your bets and then you pay the price
[00:31.25] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[00:57.75] 
[00:37.37] Communication is the problem to the answer
[00:41.83] You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
[00:46.20] The weather's turned and all the lines are down
[00:49.64] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[01:16.14] 
[00:53.96] Like walking in the rain and the snow
[00:57.45] When there's nowhere to go
[01:00.18] When you're feeling like a part of you is dying
[01:04.33] And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
[01:08.92] You think you're gonna break up
[01:11.04] Then she says she wants to make up
[01:28.04] 
[01:15.00] Ooh, you make me love you
[01:19.69] Ooh, you've got a way
[01:23.97] Ooh, you had me crawling up the wall
[01:41.97] 
[01:54.32] Like walking in the rain and the snow
[01:57.84] When there's nowhere to go
[02:00.22] When you're feeling like a part of you is dying
[02:04.72] And you're looking for the answer in her eyes
[02:09.10] You think you're gonna break up
[02:11.22] Then she says she wants to make up
[02:28.22] 
[02:15.23] Ooh, you make me love you
[02:19.58] Ooh, you've got a way
[02:24.06] Ooh, you had me crawling up the wall
[02:42.06] 
[02:33.12] A compromise would surely help the situation
[02:37.92] Agree to disagree, but disagree to part
[02:42.28] When after all it's just a compromise
[02:45.50] Of the things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[03:13.50] 
[02:49.90] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[02:54.23] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[02:58.86] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[03:03.36] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[03:07.69] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[03:12.12] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
[03:16.49] The things we do for love (The things we do for love)
