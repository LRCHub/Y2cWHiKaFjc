It's not easy they say it is for birds and bees
But i'm the one who's always confused
So believe me, i mean it all honestly
Or not the one who's being used

I'm holding back
Must be losing my knack
Guess these are the things you do for love
For love

You stare inside there's more to this than meets the eye
But i can never put you down
And no one knows the way it is or how it goes
But i would never let you down

I'm holding back
Must be losing my knack
Guess these are the things you do for love
For love

That's not right
It's not good
I wanna love you i would if i could

I'm holding back
Must be losing my knack
Guess these are the things you do for love
For love

It's not easy they say it is for birds and bees
But i'm the one who's all confused
So believe me, i mean it all honestly
Or not the one who's being used

I'm just holding back
Must be losing my knack
Guess these are the things you do

I'm holding back
Must be losing my knack
Guess these are the things you do for love

For love (Guess these are the things you do)
For love (Guess these are the things you do)
For love (Guess these are the things you do)
